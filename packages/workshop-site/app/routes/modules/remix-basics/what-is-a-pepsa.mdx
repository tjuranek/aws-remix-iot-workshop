## What is a PESPA?

PESPA stands for **Progressively Enhanced Single Page Application**. Remix is a
paving the way for PESPAs as it's focused on the fundamentals of the web while
still maintaining a modern user experience. To really understand what that means
we need to go back through a few prior iterations of web architecture.

<br />

### Multi-Page Apps (MPAs)

In earlier days, applications were written for the server. The users browser was
responsible for submitting requests to retrieve and mutate that data.

Getting documents was simple. The user entered a URL and the server determined
what HTML needs sent as a response. The browser gave a pending state, typically
through the favicon, and then rendered returned HTML.

Posting data was really only done one way. A user would submit a form and the
browser would send that serialized form data to the server. The server would
mutate the data and return a redirect so the browser follow the above process to
get the updated data.

**MPA Pros:**

- The mental model behind MPAs is really simple.
- State is handled by cookies sent over requests.

<br />

**MPA Cons:**

- Full page refreshes limit or make good UX difficult.
- It's impractical, image a full refresh every time a tweet gets liked.

<br />

### Single Page Apps (SPAs)

Skipping a couple trends between MPAs and SPAs, Single Page Apps moved much of
the code from the server to the client. This let us create awesome user
experiences by running much of our application in client side JavaScript.

Getting documents was much different than MPAs. The user would get a static file
that loads JavaScript to handle routing, data fetching, and rendering. The
server was only responsible for persisted data.

Mutations happened when a user submitted form that changed the client data
state. Actions submitted to a server would come back with new data cause client
re-renders.

**SPA Pros:**

- Much more control of the clients browser
- Powerful capabilities to build great user experiences

<br />

**SPA Cons:**

- State management took up lots, maybe even most, of the code we wrote.
- Keeping state up to date and dealing with client/server interaction was the
  primary complexity in most SPAs.
- We wrote our own form handling with prevent default and fetch.
- Code was duplicated a lot between the client and server.

### Introducing PESPAs

Historically we've seen that MPAs have a simple mental model and SPAs have more
powerful capabilities. If only there was a way to have the simplicity of MPAs
with the capabilities of SPAs.

That's what a Progressively Enhanced Single Page App is. Progressive enhancment
means we have a functional application even without Javascript, but more
importantly a simpler structure to our application. Even with progressive
enhancement, we stick to browser basics and smartly revalidate data in a way
that doesn't require a full page reload and keeps great UX a top priority.

Getting data is a breeze, the initial HTML is server rendered and JavaScript is
loaded to enhance the experience for user interactions.

Mutations happen through form and routing logic calls corresponding actions on
the server. After a action occurs, the router knows to revalidate data for the
current UI or redirect to a new page.

**PESPA Pros:**

- Functionality is the baseline
- JavaScript is for enhancemnt, not enablement.
- Lazy loading and smart pre-fetching is made easy.
- Code stays on the server.
- Using the platform is the default. The browser can do a lot!

<br />

**PESPA Cons:**

- Rendering on the server comes with its own set of challenges compared to
  client side rendering.
- Only a few frameworks support PESPAs at the time of this workshop.
- We haven't figured out everything yet, especially for more edge case
  scenarios.

Remix is an amazing framework for making PESPAs. Let's learn why and dive in!
