## Scenario

Let's put ourselves in the situation of an external developer using AWS IoT to
build a custom application for their company.

<br />

### Who are you?

You're Chris. You're an experienced software developer - the only one at a small
printing company called Printster.

Printster has a handful of machines for printing their clients books. They
include printers, binders and coverers. The machines are run by operators on the
facility floor.

<br />

### What's your project?

Amy, the project manager, learned about AWS IoT and the benefits it can bring to
their operation. She'd like you to build a proof-of-concept application that
extends AWS IoT functionality by letting her manage jobs and employees, as well
as monitor machines in real time. Amy encourages you to keep things simple until
we're ready to fully commit.

<br />

### What are the project requirements?

- Admins and employees must be able to log in with different roles
- Dashboards and task lists should be available to users
- Admins should be able to manage their employees
- Jobs should be viewable, modifiable, and creatable
- Machines should be linked and can be assigned to jobs
- Operators can be assigned to a specific machine for a specific job
