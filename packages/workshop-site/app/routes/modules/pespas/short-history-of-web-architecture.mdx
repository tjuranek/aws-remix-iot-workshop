## Short History of Web Architecture

Remix is a PEPSA - a **progressively enhanced single page application**. Before
we can really understand what that means we need to review a couple of
previously popular web architectures.

<br />

### Multi-Page Apps (MPAs)

In earlier days, applications were written for the server. The users browser was
responsible for submitting requests to retrieve and mutate that data.

Getting documents was simple. The user entered a URL and the server determined
what HTML needs sent as a response. The browser gave a pending state, typically
through the favicon, and then rendered returned HTML.

Posting data was really only done one way. A user would submit a form and the
browser would send that serialized form data to the server. The server would
mutate the data and return a redirect so the browser follow the above process to
get the updated data.

**MPA Pros:**

- The mental model behind MPAs is really simple.
- State is handled by cookies sent over requests.

<br />

**MPA Cons:**

- Full page refreshes limit or make good UX difficult.
- It's impractical, image a full refresh every time a tweet gets liked.

<br />

### Single Page Apps (SPAs)

Skipping a couple trends between MPAs and SPAs, Single Page Apps moved much of
the code from the server to the client. This let us create awesome user
experiences by running much of our application in client side JavaScript.

!['spa diagram'](https://res.cloudinary.com/epic-web/image/upload/v1665491194/epicweb.dev/blog/The%20Web%E2%80%99s%20Next%20Transition/spa.svg)

Getting documents was much different than MPAs. The user would get a static file
that loads JavaScript to handle routing, data fetching, and rendering. The
server was only responsible for persisted data.

Mutations happened when a user submitted form that changed the client data
state. Actions submitted to a server would come back with new data cause client
re-renders.

**SPA Pros:**

- Much more control of the clients browser
- Powerful capabilities to build great user experiences

<br />

**SPA Cons:**

- State management took up lots, maybe even most, of the code we wrote.
- Keeping state up to date and dealing with client/server interaction was the
  primary complexity in most SPAs.
- We wrote our own form handling with prevent default and fetch.
- Code was duplicated a lot between the client and server.
