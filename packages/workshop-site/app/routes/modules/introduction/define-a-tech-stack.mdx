## Define a Tech Stack

We've got our scenario and project requirements. Let's define how we're going to
build this.

<br />

### What's the stack for our UI?

As the only developer on the team, I want to be able to iterate quickly. I'm
familiar with JavaScript and like how I can use the same langage on both the
client application and the backend server.

I've heard about Remix being a hot new full-stack framework that makes
client/server interaction really easy. I'll try that, as well as use TypeScript
so I get end-to-end type saftey.

<br />

### What's the backend look like?

I'll need a single database instance for keeping track of the limited number of
employees and jobs that Prinster has. Since we're using AWS IoT, I'll stay on
the same provider and spin up a RDS instance.

I'm still learning about AWS IoT, but I know I need to create 'models' and
'assets' to ingest machine data and query it with AWS IoT SiteWise. I don't have
any machines hooked up yet, but it looks like SiteWise has an api I can ingest
data though. I'll mock some data and send it there to keep things simple.

<br />

### What's the infrastructure and deployment?

While reading dev blogs, I saw a post about AWS CDK. It seems like a great way
to manage the setup and teardown of AWS services through TypeScript driven
CloudFormation templates. It looks like most AWS IoT services are supported!
