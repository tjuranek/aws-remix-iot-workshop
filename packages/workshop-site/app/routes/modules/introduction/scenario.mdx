## Scenario

Let's put ourselves in the situation of a potential AWS IoT customer. They want
to build a custom application that extends AWS IoT functionality.

You've read a little bit about Remix on Twitter and dev blogs. It sounds like an
effective way to get an application up and running quickly while still working
with the JavaScript ecosystem.

Your task is to learn the what and why behind Remix. What is it is? Why does it
exist? How do I get started?
