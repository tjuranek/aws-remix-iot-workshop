## Prerequisites

I'm excited you're taking this workshop! A couple of knowledge and system setup
items are required in order to effectively follow along.

<br />

### Getting the most out of this course

This workshop is _not_ intended for absolute beginners to web development. If
you haven't written JavaScript before it will be difficult to follow along.

We're going to be using TypeScript, React, and NodeJS pretty heavily. By no
means do you need to be an expert, but it's assumed you have experience. A solid
understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and prior experience building web applications
should be a given.

<br />

### Dependencies

- Git: How code is pulled down and changed between modules.
- NodeJS (v16+): How the JavaScript is ran on your local machine.
- NPM: How we use external packages/dependencies, like Remix.

<br />

### Setup the repository

First things first, clone our repository code.

<CodeBlock
  text="git clone https://github.com/tjuranek/aws-remix-iot-workshop.git"
  language="TypeScript"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

Next, we need to install our package dependencies.

<CodeBlock
  text="npm install"
  language="TypeScript"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

Lastly, lets make sure everything is working and our dev server can start.

<CodeBlock
  text="npm run dev"
  language="TypeScript"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>
