## Why Remix

Remix is the leading web framework to offer everything previously described from
a PESPA. Remix is a bridge between our server and the client rendering our
website.

With Remix, the complexity behind routing, data fetching and mutation, and
rendering is handled for us. It's smart about what needs to be loaded and
rendered, or revalidated after a mutation occurs. It also gives us great tools
for enhancing our user experience through UI feedback like pending states and
optimistic UI.

Organizing our project in a predictable way provides many benefits. Remix has
nested routing which makes route-based code splitting possible. We see
performance and a great UI priorized while also getting a pretty easy developer
experience.

I myself have been really skeptical about frameworks in the past. I'm the type
of person who likes full control over the thing I'm building and prioritize
building features the way I want to build them. The more I use Remix, the more
I'm surpised at how sensible the opinions it has are. I've never been able to
get this much done this quickly.

In the rest of this module I want to over the three most important features of
Remix:

- Routing (What's nested routing and why does it matter?)
- Data Fetching (How does fetching and rendering from the server benefit us?)
- Data Mutation (I'm familiar with my fetch requests and form libraries, do I
  really need to switch?)
