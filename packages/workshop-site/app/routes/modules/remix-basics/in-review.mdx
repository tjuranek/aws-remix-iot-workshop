## In Review

We just went over a lot! Lets recap:

- We learned what a PESPA is and how Remix is a tool to create one.
- We saw how to create Remix applications from scratch or using premade
  'stacks'.
- We tried out nested routing and saw how we can easily share layouts and
  parameters between routes.
- We brought data into our application through loaders and learned about their
  benefits with nested routing.
- We wrote data to our application through forms and actions.

<br />

We've scraped the surface of Remix. These three things are the most important
features in my opinion - but there's lots more. Remix lets us create excellent
UI experiences really easily. There's a lot more use cases for using actions to
mutate data. With React 18 and Remix we can even create concurrent UIs pretty
simply with `Suspense`.

In the next section I'll quickly demo many of these features so we start to
understand how Remix is a full framework and not just a routing and data
platform for React.
