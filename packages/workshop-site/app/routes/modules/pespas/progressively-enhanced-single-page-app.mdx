### Introducing PESPAs

Historically we've seen that MPAs have a simple mental model and SPAs have more
powerful capabilities. If only there was a way to have the simplicity of MPAs
with the capabilities of SPAs.

That's what a Progressively Enhanced Single Page App is. Progressive enhancment
means we have a functional application even without Javascript, but more
importantly a simpler structure to our application. Even with progressive
enhancement, we stick to browser basics and smartly revalidate data in a way
that doesn't require a full page reload and keeps great UX a top priority.

Getting data is a breeze, the initial HTML is server rendered and JavaScript is
loaded to enhance the experience for user interactions.

Mutations happen through form and routing logic calls corresponding actions on
the server. After a action occurs, the router knows to revalidate data for the
current UI or redirect to a new page.

**PESPA Pros:**

- Functionality is the baseline
- JavaScript is for enhancemnt, not enablement.
- Lazy loading and smart pre-fetching is made easy.
- Code stays on the server.
- Using the platform is the default. The browser can do a lot!

<br />

**PESPA Cons:**

- Rendering on the server comes with its own set of challenges compared to
  client side rendering.
- Only a few frameworks support PESPAs at the time of this workshop.
- We haven't figured out everything yet, especially for more edge case
  scenarios.

Remix is an amazing framework for making PESPAs. Let's learn why and dive in!
