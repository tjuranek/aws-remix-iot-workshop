## data fetching

in most web applications we have a database or api we need to retrieve data
from. we're using react - we'll probably use `redux` or `react-query` to fetch
this data, right?

wrong. remix has **amazing** ways to load data based on the route you're on and
render that into your page on the server. let's check it out.

<br />

### loaders

the route modules we defined in the last section are capable of more than just
default exports of the jsx you want to render. we can also export a `loader`.
it's a named export that gets called before the jsx is rendered on the server.

we can query data in these loaders and return the data back to the component as
json. we're able to acess that data with the `useloaderdata()` hook. let's look
at a couple examples:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export async function loader() {
  const authors = await getauthorsfromdb();
  return json({ authors });
}

`} language="typescript" showlinenumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

above is a basic loader that retrieves the authors from the database. this
happens on the server. the response is an ok response with a json body that
contains the authors.

let's look at a little bit of a more complex example:

<codeblock
  text={`
export async function loader(params) {
  const { authorid, bookid } = params;
  const author = getauthor(authorid);
  const book = getbook(bookid);
  return json({ author, book });
}

`} language="typescript" showlinenumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

this gets the `$authorid` and `$bookid` from the path and uses them to fetch
data. we then return both items. what if we wanted to display that data though?
that's where the `useloaderdata()` hook comes in!

<codeblock
  text={`
export async function loader(params) {
  const { authorid, bookid } = params;
  const author = getauthor(authorid);
  const book = getbook(bookid);
  return json({ author, book });
}

export default function myroute(params) {
  const { author, book } = useloaderdata();
  return (); // return jsx to render data
}

`} language="typescript" showlinenumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

isn't this awesome? remix provided an opinionated way to load data into
components at specific routes. it's as easy as defining a function and then
using a hook to access the retrieved data.

### loaders vs redux

i really want to drive this home. in present-day development we're so used to
using big tools like redux to get and manage application state. let's go over a
flow chart of what just happened.

with redux, a user interaction causes a dispatch in remix which initiates a
fetch request. the api and database get that data back to the redux reducer,
which updates the store and then re-renders the application.

remix is much more serial. we hit the server, which loads the data from the api,
and then re-renders the application. it's a really simple mental model. think
for a bit about how much less code was written and needs to be tested compared
to a redux store, dispatch, and reducer! ðŸ¤¯

### reviewing the network waterfall

beyond code complexity, remix provides another awesome advantage to other ways
of loading data. because we use nested routing in remix we know exactly what
needs loaded just based off the url. if i go to `/authors/001/books/002`, remix
will look at all of the loaders in those routes all at once and initiate those
fetches. if you compare this to other methods where the data fetch is
initialized when the component renders in the application, it's much faster.
here's a graph:

notice that with remix, all the requests cause by the loaders are initialized at
once. without remix we have to wait for one request to come back before we know
what other requests need to happen.
