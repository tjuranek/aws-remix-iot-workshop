## Creating a Project

When getting started with Remix you have a couple of options. Either use the CLI
to create a new project from scratch, or get started with 'Remix Stacks'. We'll
briefly review each.

**You don't need to do any of this for the workshop.**

<br />

### The Remix CLI

To get the basics running all you need to do is run `npx create-remix@latest`
with a project name. This uses the `node package executer` to run the
`create-remix` package. It walks you through project setup - including usage of
TypeScript and deployment targets.

<CodeBlock
  text="npx create-remix@latest my-project"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

If you're opinionated about what non-Remix libraries you'd like to use with your
application this is a great starting place.

<br />

### Remix Stacks

Stacks are pre-configured Remix applications that are ready for deployment. The
official stacks that are built into the CLI include a database, automatic
deployment pipelines, authentication, testing, linting, and formatting.

There are currently three stacks available, the 'Blues' stack, the 'Indie'
stack, and the 'Grunge' stack. They differ on a few things, but primarily
deployment targets and database type.

To get started with stacks run you add your template as a flag to the
`create-remix` package upon execution:

<CodeBlock
  text="npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/indie-stack my-project"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />
<br />

### Conclusion

We can create Remix with minimal configuration, or use a premade stack created
by the Remix team. By cloning the workshop repository in the previous module you
already have a project that's ready to go for the rest of the workshop!
